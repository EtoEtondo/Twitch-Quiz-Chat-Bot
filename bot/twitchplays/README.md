# Twitch Plays Bot

The code of our Bot based on a simple Twitch Plays implementation shown here.

## About

The quiz project set up by this twitch plays bot which you can individually configure. It uses [AHK](https://autohotkey.com) to take the inputs of the chat and execute them. Please feel free to expand my solution.

## Nice to know

The chat inputs are an addition to your inputs. So your inputs will allways be higher priority and will be completed by the chat input.
This script is good for basic games like for GBA. Also keep in mind that you can change the inputs on your emulators etc. 
Another big point is the list of keys you can find [here] (https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm).
If AHK is not working you can use [Keyboard](https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/) instead.
